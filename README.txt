In an effort to make transparent and reproducible science, we have included all the data for this project with guiding insights that we arrived at along the way for why we analyzed the data the way we did. While this is some of the code that is directly pertinent to this publication and project, we do have considerable other analysis completed using these data. We have tried to structure the data in the easiest way to deal with it such that non-technical users in the physiology and critical care communities can hopefully access our work without being frustrated.

OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
Code (A singular RMarkdown file with .html output)
"./R files"

Data Source Location:
"./data_input"

Data Outputs - Graphs, Individual Responses, Generated spreadsheets)
"./data_output"

In this project version on GitHub (20251016), output files are not generated to reduce the size of this repository. It is our hope that with downloading this project and having the requisite R dependencies, that the RMarkdown file should be able to automatically be generated by "knitting" the document which will in turn generate all figures in the data_output folder.

Thank you for your interest in our work and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
