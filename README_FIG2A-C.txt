The original figure and the revised figure as sent to our authorship team had the only differences of being a .jpg vs pdf, and us swapping the labels to WLST from WLSM.

- The correct version is using WLST for this figure as that is the terminology that is used in the manuscript. (see new updated)
- The .jpg version exported from R provides higher quality on-graph text despite the exact same dimensions and dpi between .jpg and .pdf file formats. To try and resolve this problem, I have slightly increased the font size and removed the italics from the font on this revised version. Because of this difference in quality, I have also included the .jpg version in case that is of better use to you.

Please let me know if there are any other issues and I apologize for the inconvenience as I've been learning to navigate some of this file format work. ~ Jordan Bird
