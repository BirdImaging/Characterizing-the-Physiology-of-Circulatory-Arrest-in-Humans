These area under the curve data (AUC) come from linear interpolation data of the human dying process (as there is occasionally artifact and missing data) which was then quantified for different hypoxemic or hypotensive thresholds. Note that the overall magnitude will be different between the different functional thresholds due to the relative starting baseline and different normative values for each variable.
